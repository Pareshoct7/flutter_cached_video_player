# Cached Video Player Example

## Getting Started
To run, just clone the repo and run `flutter run` in the example directory.

## Testing Cache capability
To check the caching feature, run the app once when internet is available. Let the video play for a while. After that close the app, turn off the internet and run it again. You'll see that the even without internet the video will play as much as it was buffered in the last play.
